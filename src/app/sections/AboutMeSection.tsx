              <p>I grew up in Frankfurt, Germany and quickly stumbled over game development as a child.
                <br />
                <br />
                With time, my passion for code matured and developed into what it is today and has enabled me to keep sharpening my software develoment skills.
                <br />
                <br />
                Today, I enjoy analyzing problems and developing solutions. I love conceptualising systems, finding real life applications for my skillset and seeing a project come to life piece by piece.
