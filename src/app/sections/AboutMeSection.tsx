                I grew up in Frankfurt, Germany and quickly stumbled over game
                development as a child.
                <br />
                <br />
                With time, my passion for code matured and developed into what
                it is today and has enabled me to keep sharpening my software
                develoment skills.
                <br />
                <br />
                Today, I enjoy analyzing problems and developing solutions. I
                love conceptualising systems, finding real life applications for
                my skillset and seeing a project come to life piece by piece.
                <br />
                Next to my interest in software, I also enjoy utilising music
                and art as a creative outlet.
